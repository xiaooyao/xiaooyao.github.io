My hobby? Giving old tech a second life—or a gloriously weird third one. That sluggish laptop destined for e-waste? Challenge accepted. That phone older than some memes? Perfect candidate for a software transplant. My desk isn’t messy; it’s an “active archaeological dig site” for silicon. My learning curve is 90% glorious failures. This blog documents the journey: the wins, the facepalms, and the quiet chaos of commands that broke everything at 2 AM. I once tried to make a smart toaster. It just toasted the word “HELP” onto bread. We don’t talk about that. I believe tech should work for you, not the other way around. So, I’m all about practical mischief: automating boring tasks, squeezing performance from hardware that officially “retired,” and writing scripts that basically do my chores. Think of it as digital duct tape and hope. This blog is my lab notebook—a mix of semi-coherent tutorials, troubleshooting war stories, and thoughts that hit during my fourth cup of coffee. It’s for anyone who’s ever thought, “I could probably fix this,” right before making it significantly worse (and then actually fixing it). If you also speak in error logs, believe sudo is a magic word, and find the sound of a server booting up calming… you might be my kind of people. TL;DR: I poke machines until they do cool things. Sometimes they fight back. Let’s laugh about it. P.S. My spirit animal is a Rasberry Pi running a pointless but beautiful script. My greatest fear is a missing semicolon.","link":"about/index.html"}]}
